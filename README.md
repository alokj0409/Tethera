# TETHERA

TETHERA is a one-thumb kinetic-physics puzzle game about turning momentum into precise, satisfying arcs. Plant an anchor, hold to orbit, and release to send a luminous orb through a field of resonant targets, hazards, and increasingly strange spatial mechanics.

## Current status

**Targets, lethal spikes, and level outcomes are live; deterministic Tier 01-05 generation is next.** Swept collision tests collect target cores without ordinary tunneling, fail on the visible triangle edges, and activate the victory/game-over flow while retaining direct restart and next-level input.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser, or serve this directory with any static file server and open its root URL. The current scaffold displays the TETHERA logical playfield; gameplay is added in later checkpoints.

No package manager, dependency installation, bundler, or external asset download will be required.

## Controls

- Press or touch anywhere in the play area to plant an anchor and tether the orb.
- Hold to keep the tether active and orbit the anchor.
- Release to snap the tether and continue in free flight.
- Press the circular-arrow control at bottom right to restart the current level.
- Clear every target before the allotted tether count reaches zero.

The controls, physics, target collection, spike failure, victory, and reset loop are interactive. Layouts are still fixed placeholders until deterministic generation lands.

The remaining planned runtime file is `audio.js`; it will be added with the procedural-audio checkpoint.

## Source of truth

[`PRD.md`](PRD.md) is authoritative for product requirements. `SPECS.md` and `RULES.md` describe what the checked-in code actually does and must be updated whenever implementation behavior changes. `DECISIONS.md` records choices the PRD leaves open.
